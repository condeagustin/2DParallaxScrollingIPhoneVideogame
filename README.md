# 2DParallaxScrollingIPhoneVideogame

In this personal project, I made a 2D videogame demo on iPhone, using the Parallax Scrolling technique for creating the illusion of depth.
 
This demo was implemented in XCode with Objective-C, OpenGL ES 1.1 and OpenAL.
 
I programmed the whole demo and I also designed the tile map level showed in the video.
 
The parallax scrolling technique was implemented in this way: the background is composed of 3 layers (excluding the tile map) where each one has different speeds depending on the player speed. In that way it gives the illusion of depth where the farthest things appear to move slower than the nearest things from the player.
 
The accelerometer was used to make the player run left or right and jump. The player can also jump by touching the screen.
 
Many thanks to:
 
- My cousin Raul S. Rubio for composing the awesome background music from scratch.
 
- Michael Daley for his excellent OpenGL ES and OpenAL tutorials at http://maniacdev.com/2010/01/incredible-iphone-game-programming-tutorials-with-video/
 
- Microsoft XNA Platformer Template for the great assets (sprites, sounds, tiles).
